# Context Analysis Constitutional Skill

Analyze context quality using constitutional principles with progressive disclosure implementation and cognitive optimization.

## Purpose

This skill evaluates the quality of input context using five-dimensional metrics while ensuring constitutional compliance and cognitive optimization. It follows progressive disclosure for scalable analysis.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Evaluating context quality before processing
- Applying constitutional validation to content
- Performing cognitive optimization analysis
- Following progressive disclosure principles

## Instructions

To analyze context quality constitutionally:

1. Provide context in input parameter
2. Execute analysis with constitutional validation
3. Review five-dimensional quality metrics
4. Apply cognitive optimization suggestions

Input format:
```
{
    "context": "Context to analyze",
    "detailed": true/false
}
```

## Constitutional Principles Applied

The skill implements:
- Progressive disclosure: Scalable analysis from basic to detailed
- Cognitive convenience: Clear, self-explanatory results
- Information encapsulation: Self-contained analysis
- Cognitive gestalt: Complete analysis units

## Output Metrics

Provides five-dimensional quality metrics:
- Clarity (0.0-1.0): Expression clearness
- Relevance (0.0-1.0): Task relevance
- Completeness (0.0-1.0): Information completeness
- Consistency (0.0-1.0): Logical consistency
- Efficiency (0.0-1.0): Information density

## Quality Thresholds

- High quality: ≥ 0.7
- Medium quality: ≥ 0.4
- Low quality: < 0.4
