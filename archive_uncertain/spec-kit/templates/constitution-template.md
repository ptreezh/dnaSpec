## Version: 1.0

## 1. Project Principles

### 1.1 Quality Principles
- **Code Quality**: All code must be clean, readable, and maintainable
- **Testing**: All functionality must be properly tested with adequate coverage
- **Performance**: Applications must meet defined performance benchmarks
- **Security**: Security best practices must be followed throughout development
- **Accessibility**: Applications must be accessible to all users

### 1.2 Development Principles
- **Collaboration**: Team members should actively collaborate and share knowledge
- **Communication**: Clear and frequent communication is essential
- **Decision-Making**: Technical decisions must be documented and justified
- **Change Management**: Changes must follow the established process
- **Documentation**: All significant decisions and processes must be documented

### 1.3 Technical Principles
- **Architecture**: Follow the architecture guidelines defined in the technical plan
- **Technology Selection**: New technologies must align with the established stack
- **Integration**: Components should be designed for easy integration
- **Data Management**: Follow data management best practices
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling approach across the application

## 2. Coding Standards

### 2.1 Code Style
- **Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes and components
- **Formatting**: Use 2 spaces for indentation, consistent bracket placement
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and public APIs
- **Documentation**: Follow the documentation standards defined for this project

### 2.2 Architecture Standards
- **Component Organization**: Organize code by feature or component
- **Dependencies**: Manage dependencies carefully, avoid circular dependencies
- **Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces between components
- **Error Handling**: Use consistent error handling patterns

### 2.3 Testing Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain at least 80% test coverage for critical functionality
- **Testing Approach**: Use unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for components
- **Test Organization**: Organize tests to match the structure of the codebase
- **Performance Testing**: Include performance tests for critical paths

## 3. Development Practices

### 3.1 Version Control
- **Branching Strategy**: Use GitFlow or feature branch workflow
- **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commit message format
- **Code Reviews**: All code must be reviewed before merging
- **Merge Requirements**: Pass all tests before merging to main branch

### 3.2 Project Management
- **Task Tracking**: Use the defined task tracking system
- **Planning**: Participate in sprint/iteration planning
- **Progress Reporting**: Provide regular progress updates
- **Communication**: Use designated channels for project communication

### 3.3 Quality Assurance
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on quality and consistency
- **Testing Procedures**: Follow the defined testing procedures
- **Deployment Validation**: Validate deployments in staging before production
- **Monitoring**: Implement appropriate monitoring and logging

## 4. Governance Structure

### 4.1 Decision-Making Process
- **Technical Decisions**: Major technical decisions require team discussion and agreement
- **Conflict Resolution**: Technical disagreements will be resolved through discussion and, if needed, escalation
- **Escalation**: Define when and how to escalate issues

### 4.2 Change Management
- **Proposal**: Changes should be proposed with clear justification
- **Approval**: Changes require appropriate approval based on impact
- **Communication**: Approved changes must be communicated to all team members
