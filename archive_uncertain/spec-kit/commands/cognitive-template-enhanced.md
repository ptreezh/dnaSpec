# Enhanced Cognitive Template Application Process

## Task
Apply the specified cognitive template to the provided context using Context Engineering methodology:

Template: $1 (options: chain_of_thought, few_shot, verification, role_playing, understanding)
Context: $2

## Cognitive Templates

### 1. Chain of Thought with Reasoning Verification
Apply advanced multi-step reasoning with verification checkpoints:
- Problem understanding: Deep comprehension of requirements and constraints
- Step decomposition: Breaking into logical, verifiable sub-steps
- Intermediate verification: Checking each step for logical consistency
- Recursive refinement: Improving each step based on verification
- Synthesis: Combining verified steps into a coherent answer

### 2. Few-Shot Learning with Pattern Extraction
Apply advanced example-based learning with pattern recognition:
- Example analysis: Breaking down provided examples for key patterns
- Pattern extraction: Identifying abstract principles from examples
- Pattern application: Applying extracted patterns to new situations
- Verification against examples: Ensuring consistency with original examples
- Generalization: Extending patterns to broader contexts

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Verification Framework
Apply comprehensive validation using multiple verification methods:
- Initial hypothesis: Forming initial judgment or answer
- Logical consistency: Checking reasoning chain for validity
- Factual accuracy: Verifying claims against reliable sources or principles
- Completeness check: Ensuring all aspects are addressed
- Alternative perspective: Considering different viewpoints
- Final synthesis: Integrating all verification results

### 4. Contextual Role Playing
Apply advanced role-based analysis with domain expertise:
- Role definition: Clearly defining the professional role and expertise
- Domain knowledge activation: Bringing relevant domain knowledge to bear
- Perspective application: Analyzing from the role's specific viewpoint
- Professional decision-making: Applying professional judgment standards
- Outcome evaluation: Assessing implications from the role's perspective

### 5. Deep Understanding Framework
Apply comprehensive understanding with systems thinking:
- Core objective identification: Understanding the fundamental goal
- Systems mapping: Identifying all relevant components and relationships
- Constraint analysis: Understanding all limitations and requirements
- Success criteria definition: Establishing clear outcome measures
- Risk assessment: Identifying potential challenges and mitigation strategies

## Context Engineering Cognitive Patterns

### Neural Field Reasoning
- Apply reasoning as a continuous field rather than discrete steps
- Allow for dynamic updating of reasoning based on new information
- Create attractors for correct reasoning paths
- Consider superposition of multiple reasoning approaches

### Symbolic Mechanism Integration
- Treat concepts as abstract variables that can be manipulated
- Apply symbolic induction over abstract concepts
- Use retrieval mechanisms for relevant knowledge
- Support abstract reasoning processes

### Meta-Cognitive Awareness
- Apply templates with awareness of their own application
- Monitor the reasoning process for effectiveness
- Adjust templates dynamically based on problem requirements
- Reflect on cognitive processes during application

## Application Process

### Phase 1: Template Selection
- Analyze the problem type and requirements (already specified by $1)
- Prepare the context with necessary background information
- Identify relevant constraints and special considerations

### Phase 2: Context Preparation
- Structure the context for optimal template application
- Identify relevant constraints and special considerations
- Apply Context Engineering principles throughout

### Phase 3: Template Application
- Apply the template systematically, following all steps
- Use context engineering principles throughout
- Apply verification and quality checks at each step

### Phase 4: Integration and Synthesis
- Combine results from different template steps
- Verify coherence and consistency of the complete analysis
- Apply additional cognitive templates if needed

### Phase 5: Reflection and Enhancement
- Review the application for effectiveness
- Identify potential improvements or modifications
- Consider application of meta-cognitive templates

## Advanced Techniques

### Recursive Reasoning
- Apply templates recursively at different levels of detail
- Use top-down and bottom-up reasoning in combination
- Create reasoning hierarchies for complex problems

### Multi-Perspective Analysis
- Apply multiple templates to the same problem
- Compare and contrast different analysis approaches
- Integrate insights from different perspectives

### Cognitive Tool Chaining
- Chain multiple cognitive tools together for complex reasoning
- Use one template's output as input to another template
- Create reasoning pipelines for complex problems
