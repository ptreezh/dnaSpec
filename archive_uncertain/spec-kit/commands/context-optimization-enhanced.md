# Enhanced Context Optimization Process

## Task
Optimize the following context based on Context Engineering methodology: $1

With optimization goals: $2 (default to "clarity,completeness,consistency" if not specified)

## Optimization Framework

### 1. Clarity Enhancement
Improve expression clarity by:
- Replacing ambiguous terms with precise language
- Restructuring confusing sentences
- Adding clarifying explanations where needed
- Improving logical flow of ideas

### 2. Relevance Improvement
Enhance alignment with goals by:
- Removing off-topic information
- Strengthening connections to main points
- Adding relevant details that support objectives
- Refocusing content on key themes

### 3. Completeness Enhancement
Improve information completeness by:
- Identifying and filling information gaps
- Adding missing context or background
- Including necessary details or specifications
- Ensuring all required elements are present

### 4. Conciseness Improvement
Enhance information efficiency by:
- Eliminating redundant content
- Streamlining verbose explanations
- Removing unnecessary repetition
- Reducing overall length while preserving meaning

### 5. Consistency Enhancement
Improve internal coherence by:
- Standardizing terminology throughout
- Resolving contradictions
- Ensuring logical flow between sections
- Maintaining consistent tone and style

## Context Engineering Optimization Techniques

### Token Budget Management
- Optimize content to fit within token constraints
- Balance information density with readability
- Apply progressive disclosure for complex topics
- Prioritize high-value information in limited space

### Memory Integration
- Structure content for easy recall and reference
- Create clear sectioning for long contexts
- Add contextual markers and anchors
- Optimize for multi-turn conversations

### Reasoning Architecture Support
- Structure content to support step-by-step reasoning
- Create clear pathways for logical analysis
- Include verification checkpoints
- Add decision points for complex reasoning

## Process to Follow

### Phase 1: Context Analysis
- Evaluate current context quality using context engineering metrics
- Identify optimization priorities based on specified goals
- Assess the current token budget and structural elements

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning
- Select optimization techniques based on identified issues
- Plan the sequence of optimizations for maximum impact
- Consider interdependencies between optimization goals

### Phase 3: Applied Optimization
- Apply optimization techniques systematically
- Preserve all essential meaning while making improvements
- Verify that optimizations don't create new issues

### Phase 4: Quality Verification
- Re-assess the context after optimization
- Ensure all optimization goals were met
- Verify that no important information was lost

### Phase 5: Pattern Application
- Apply relevant context engineering patterns
- Suggest cognitive templates that could enhance the content
- Recommend follow-up optimizations if needed

## Advanced Patterns

### Cognitive Template Integration
- Apply chain of thought for complex explanations
- Use few-shot patterns where examples are needed
- Apply verification frameworks for critical content
- Use role-playing templates for perspective-based content

### Field Theory Applications
- Consider context as a semantic field
- Apply boundary management principles
- Optimize for resonance with intended meaning
- Structure content to create attractors for correct understanding
