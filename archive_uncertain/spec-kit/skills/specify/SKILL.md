# SpecKit - Specification Creation

## Overview
This skill helps create comprehensive project specifications by focusing on requirements and purpose rather than implementation details.

## Process

### 1. Analyze Requirements
First, understand the core requirements:
- What problem is being solved?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What are the functional requirements?
- What are the non-functional requirements?

### 2. Create Specification Structure
Create a specification document that includes:

#### 2.1 Problem Statement
- Clear description of the problem
- Context and background
- Success criteria

#### 2.2 Requirements
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Constraints and assumptions

#### 2.3 Scope
- In scope items
- Out of scope items
- Dependencies

#### 2.4 Success Metrics
- How to measure success
- Key performance indicators
- Testing criteria

### 3. Validate Against Best Practices
- Ensure clarity and unambiguity
- Check completeness against requirements
- Verify feasibility within constraints

## Examples
- When creating a web application: "Specify the core functionality of a user dashboard including authentication, data visualization, and reporting features"
- When building an API: "Specify the requirements for a RESTful API for user management including endpoints, authentication, rate limiting"
- When developing a data pipeline: "Specify the requirements for processing and analyzing large datasets with specific performance and reliability requirements"

## Guidelines
- Focus on what needs to be built, not how it will be built
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Include measurable success criteria
- Consider all stakeholders' needs
- Specify constraints and limitations upfront
- Document dependencies and assumptions
