# SpecKit - Project Constitution

## Overview
This skill helps establish project principles, coding standards, and development practices that serve as the foundational guidelines for the entire development process, ensuring consistency and quality throughout the project lifecycle.

## Process

### 1. Define Project Principles
Establish core principles that will guide all development decisions:

#### 1.1 Quality Principles
- Code quality standards
- Testing requirements
- Performance expectations
- Security considerations
- Accessibility requirements

#### 1.2 Development Principles
- Collaboration approach
- Communication standards
- Decision-making processes
- Change management procedures
- Documentation requirements

#### 1.3 Technical Principles
- Architecture guidelines
- Technology selection criteria
- Integration patterns
- Data management standards
- Error handling approaches

### 2. Establish Coding Standards
Define coding standards that all team members should follow:

#### 2.1 Code Style
- Naming conventions
- Formatting guidelines
- Comment standards
- Documentation requirements
- Import organization

#### 2.2 Architecture Standards
- Component organization
- Dependency management
- Interface design
- Error handling patterns
- Configuration management

#### 2.3 Testing Standards
- Test coverage requirements
- Testing approach (unit, integration, e2e)
- Test organization and naming
- Mocking strategies
- Performance testing criteria

### 3. Set Development Practices
Define development practices and workflows:

#### 3.1 Version Control
- Branching strategy
- Commit message standards
- Code review process
- Merge requirements
- Release procedures

#### 3.2 Project Management
- Task tracking approach
- Sprint/iteration planning
- Progress reporting
- Issue escalation procedures
- Stakeholder communication

#### 3.3 Quality Assurance
- Code review standards
- Testing procedures
- Deployment validation
- Monitoring requirements
- Incident response

### 4. Document Governance Structure
Establish how decisions will be made and governance maintained:

#### 4.1 Decision-making Process
- Who decides what
- How conflicts are resolved
- When to escalate issues
- Review and update procedures
- Stakeholder involvement

#### 4.2 Change Management
- How changes are proposed
- Approval processes
- Communication of changes
- Rollback procedures
- Version control for the constitution itself

## Examples
- For a new application: "Establish principles for a web application project including React/Node.js technology standards, Gitflow workflow, code review requirements, and testing coverage targets"
- For an API project: "Define constitution for API development including REST standards, authentication requirements, documentation standards, and rate limiting policies"
- For a data project: "Set guidelines for data pipeline development including Apache Spark usage patterns, data quality requirements, and monitoring standards"

## Guidelines
- Keep principles high-level but actionable
- Ensure standards are measurable and enforceable
- Consider team skill levels and constraints
- Align with organizational standards where possible
- Plan for regular review and updates
- Make constitution easily accessible to all team members
- Define clear consequences for violations
- Establish change approval processes
- Balance flexibility with consistency
