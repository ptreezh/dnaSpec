# SpecKit - Task Breakdown

## Overview
This skill helps break down project specifications and technical plans into executable tasks with clear responsibilities, dependencies, and success criteria to facilitate organized implementation.

## Process

### 1. Analyze Specifications and Plans
First, review the project specifications and technical plans to understand:
- Functionality requirements
- Technical architecture
- Technology stack
- Dependencies and constraints
- Success criteria

### 2. Create Task Categories
Organize tasks into meaningful categories:

#### 2.1 Setup Tasks
- Environment setup
- Tool installation
- Repository initialization
- Configuration files creation

#### 2.2 Infrastructure Tasks
- Server setup
- Database setup
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Testing environment setup

#### 2.3 Development Tasks
- Core functionality implementation
- UI/UX development
- API development
- Integration tasks
- Security implementation

#### 2.4 Testing Tasks
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing

#### 2.5 Deployment Tasks
- Staging deployment
- Production deployment
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring setup

### 3. Define Task Properties
For each task, define:

#### 3.1 Task Description
- Clear, specific description of what needs to be done
- Expected outcome or deliverable

#### 3.2 Estimation
- Complexity level (S/M/L/XL)
- Time estimation (if required)
- Risk assessment

#### 3.3 Dependencies
- Prerequisites from other tasks
- External dependencies
- Resource requirements

#### 3.4 Success Criteria
- How to verify the task is complete
- Acceptance criteria
- Quality standards

### 4. Assign Priorities and Grouping
- Priority levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Sprint or phase assignment
- Team member assignment (if applicable)

## Examples
- For a web application: "Break down the user dashboard implementation into tasks including authentication system, data fetching components, visualization modules, and responsive design implementation"
- For an API: "Create tasks for implementing user management endpoints including user creation, authentication, permission system, and data validation"
- For a data pipeline: "Break down the data processing pipeline into ingestion, transformation, storage, and monitoring tasks"

## Guidelines
- Keep tasks small and manageable (2-5 hours of work ideally)
- Ensure clear dependencies between tasks
- Define measurable success criteria
- Consider parallel task execution opportunities
- Include testing and documentation tasks
- Account for integration tasks between components
- Plan for error handling and edge cases
- Review and refine task breakdown regularly
