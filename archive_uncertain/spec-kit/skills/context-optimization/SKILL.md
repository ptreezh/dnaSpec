# Context Optimization

## Overview
Optimize context quality based on specific goals. This skill takes existing content and improves it according to selected optimization goals such as clarity, relevance, completeness, conciseness, and consistency.

## Optimization Goals

- Replacing ambiguous terms with precise language
- Restructuring confusing sentences
- Adding clarifying explanations where needed
- Improving the logical flow of ideas

### 2. Relevance Improvement
Enhance the alignment with goals by:
- Removing off-topic information
- Strengthening connections to main points
- Adding relevant details that support objectives
- Refocusing content on key themes

### 3. Completeness Enhancement
Improve information completeness by:
- Identifying and filling information gaps
- Adding missing context or background
- Including necessary details or specifications
- Ensuring all required elements are present

### 4. Conciseness Improvement
Enhance information efficiency by:
- Eliminating redundant content
- Streamlining verbose explanations
- Removing unnecessary repetition
- Reducing overall length while preserving meaning

### 5. Consistency Enhancement
Improve internal coherence by:
