## Coding Guidelines
Please follow these guidelines when contributing code:

### TypeScript
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Add JSDoc comments for all public functions and classes
- Keep files under 500 lines when possible

### File Organization
- Use singular form for directory and file names
- Group related files in directories
- No directory should contain more than 7 files
- Each directory must have a README.md explaining its purpose

### Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally

Example:
```
fix: resolve MCP connection timeout issue

- Add keep-alive mechanism to prevent connection timeouts
- Improve error handling for network issues
- Update documentation with connection troubleshooting tips

Fixes #123
```

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for individual functions and classes
- Write integration tests for component interactions
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage
- Test both success and error cases
