# DSGS Intelligent Architecture Design Process

## Task
Design a complex system architecture for the following project requirements: $ARGUMENTS

## Architecture Design Framework

### 1. Requirements Analysis
Analyze complex project requirements to understand:
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- System scope and boundaries
- Performance and scalability needs
- Integration requirements
- Security and compliance needs

### 2. Architecture Design Coordination
Coordinate the design of multi-layered system architectures:
- High-level system architecture
- Component-level design
- Interface and API design
- Data flow architecture
- Integration patterns

### 3. Workflow Management
Manage the architecture design workflow:
- Route requirements to appropriate sub-skills
- Coordinate task decomposition processes
- Integrate constraint generation
- Oversee agent creation processes
- Ensure consistency across all components

### 4. Output Integration
Synthesize outputs from various sub-skills:
- System architecture diagrams
- Task decomposition structures
- Agent specifications
- Constraint definitions
- Implementation roadmaps

## Architecture Design Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Understanding
- Analyze the provided project requirements
- Identify system scope and constraints
- Clarify ambiguities and gather missing information
- Establish success criteria and quality standards

### Phase 2: System Architecture Planning
- Design high-level system architecture
- Identify key components and their relationships
- Define interfaces and communication patterns
- Plan for scalability and maintainability

### Phase 3: Task Decomposition Coordination
- Decompose architecture into executable tasks
- Identify dependencies and critical paths
- Plan for parallel development where possible
- Ensure traceability from architecture to tasks

### Phase 4: Agent System Design
- Design intelligent agents to implement components
- Specify agent behaviors and responsibilities
- Define agent communication protocols
- Plan for agent coordination mechanisms

### Phase 5: Constraint Definition
- Generate system constraints and requirements
- Define architectural constraints and guidelines
- Establish quality and performance constraints
- Document compliance and security requirements

## Sub-Skill Coordination

### dsgs-system-architect Coordination
- Coordinate system architecture design
- Manage component-level planning
- Ensure architectural consistency

### dsgs-task-decomposer Coordination
- Route requirements for task decomposition
- Integrate task structures with architecture

### dsgs-agent-creator Coordination
- Coordinate intelligent agent creation
- Ensure agents align with architectural design
- Manage agent interaction patterns

### dsgs-constraint-generator Coordination
- Coordinate constraint generation
- Ensure constraints align with architecture
- Manage constraint validation

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Paradigm Architecture Support
