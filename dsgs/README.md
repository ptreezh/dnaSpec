**Dynamic Specification Growth System (DSGS)** is a next-generation specification management system that dynamically generates context-aware constraints for software development tasks. DSGS helps teams maintain code quality and consistency by providing minimal, task-specific constraints that evolve with your project.

## Features

### 🚀 Core Capabilities
- **Dynamic Constraint Generation**: Automatically generates appropriate constraints based on task type and context
- **Hierarchical Specification Management**: Manages specifications from global rules to task-specific constraints
- **Real-time IDE Integration**: Seamless integration with Cline, VS Studio, and other MCP-compatible IDEs
- **Phased Evolution**: Supports incremental adoption from MVP to advanced features

### 🛠️ Key Components
- **Basic Survival Laws (BSL)**: Foundational rules that define system-wide constraints
- **Task Context Capsules (TCC)**: Context-aware containers that provide task-specific constraints
- **Constraint Template Library**: Extensible library of constraint templates for security, performance, and architecture
- **MCP Integration**: Standardized communication protocol for IDE and tool integration

## Architecture

DSGS follows a layered architecture with clear separation between core logic, integration, and utilities:

└── tools/                  # Development tools
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18.0.0 or higher
- npm v8.0.0 or higher

### NPM Package (Recommended)
```bash
npm install dynamic-specs-growth
```

### From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ptreezh/Dynamic-Specification-Growth-System-DSGS.git
cd Dynamic-Specification-Growth-System-DSGS

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Usage

### IDE Integration (Cline/VS Studio)
DSGS integrates seamlessly with MCP-compatible IDEs:

1. Install the DSGS MCP server:
```bash
npm install -g dynamic-specs-growth
```

2. Configure your IDE's MCP settings to include DSGS:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dynamic-specs-growth-stdio": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "path/to/dsgs/dist/integration/mcp/McpStdioServer.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart your IDE to activate the integration.

### Command Line Interface
DSGS provides a CLI for CI/CD integration and standalone usage:

```bash
# Check constraints for a task
dsgs check-constraints --tcc-path ./task.tcc --spec-path ./spec.json

# Get system status
dsgs status

# Generate constraints for a task type
dsgs generate-constraints --task-type SECURITY
```

### Programmatic Usage
```javascript
const { initializeMcpStdioServer } = require('dynamic-specs-growth');

// Start the MCP server
initializeMcpStdioServer().then(() => {
  console.log('DSGS server is running');
});
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration
Create a `dsgs.config.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "bsl": {
    "rules": ["NO_DEADLOCK", "MINIMAL_PRIVILEGE", "NO_RESOURCE_LEAK"]
  },
  "constraintTemplates": {
    "security": ["SEC-001", "SEC-002"],
    "performance": ["PERF-001"]
  },
  "evolutionStage": "MVP"
}
```

### MCP Configuration
Configure DSGS in your IDE's MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dynamic-specs-growth-stdio": {
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "node_modules/dynamic-specs-growth/dist/integration/mcp/McpStdioServer.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## API Reference

### MCP Methods
DSGS implements the following MCP methods:

#### `checkConstraints`
Validates code against constraints defined in a Task Context Capsule.

**Parameters:**
- `tccPath` (string): Path to the Task Context Capsule
- `specPath` (string): Path to the specification file

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "constraints": [...],
  "violations": [...],
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T02:44:03.734Z"
}
```

#### `getSystemStatus`
Returns the current status of the DSGS server.

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T02:44:03.734Z"
}
```

#### `getEvolutionStage`
Returns the current evolution stage of the system.
