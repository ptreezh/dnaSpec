# Cognitive Template Application

## Overview
Apply cognitive templates for structured thinking. This skill provides various thinking frameworks to help organize thoughts and approach problems systematically.

## Templates Available

### 1. Chain of Thought
Use this template to break down complex problems into logical steps:
- Problem understanding: Clarify the core requirements and constraints
- Step decomposition: Break the task into executable sub-steps
- Intermediate reasoning: Provide detailed thinking process at each step
- Verification check: Check reasoning process for reasonableness and logic
- Final answer: Synthesize all steps into a final result

### 2. Few-Shot Learning
Use this template when examples can guide the solution:
- Provide clear examples of input-output pairs
- Identify patterns from the examples
- Apply the learned patterns to the new task
- Explain the reasoning based on the examples

### 3. Verification Framework
Use this template to validate content or solutions:
- Initial answer: Provide initial judgment or answer
- Logical consistency check: Verify internal logical consistency
- Factual accuracy check: Check statement accuracy
- Completeness check: Assess whether all necessary information is included
- Final confirmation: Synthesize checks into final confirmation

### 4. Role Playing
Use this template to analyze from a specific professional perspective:
- Role understanding: Define the professional capabilities of the role
- Professional analysis: How would this role understand the task?
- Professional advice: What suggestions would this role make?
- Professional decision: How would this role decide?

### 5. Understanding Framework
Use this template for deep comprehension:
- Core objective: What is the main purpose?
- Key elements: What are the important components?
- Constraint conditions: What are the limitations and requirements?
- Success criteria: How to judge completion quality?
- Potential risks: What challenges might exist?

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Appropriate Template
Based on the nature of the task, select the most suitable cognitive template from the five options.

### Step 2: Apply Template Structure
Apply the selected template structure to the problem or context, ensuring all aspects of the framework are addressed.

### Step 3: Generate Structured Response
Provide a well-organized response following the template structure, with clear sections and logical flow.

## Examples
- "Apply a chain of thought approach to solve this math problem"
- "Use the verification framework to check this solution"
- "Think about this problem from the perspective of a software architect"
- "Analyze this content using the understanding framework"

## Guidelines
- Select the most appropriate template for the specific task
- Follow the structure of the chosen template precisely
- Provide detailed responses for each element of the template
- Maintain logical flow between template elements
- Use structured format to enhance clarity
