# Constitutional Cognitive Template Skill

Apply constitutional cognitive templates to enhance task processing with progressive disclosure and cognitive optimization principles.

## Purpose

This skill applies constitutional cognitive templates to structure complex tasks using proven cognitive frameworks while ensuring progressive disclosure and cognitive convenience.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Processing complex tasks with cognitive templates
- Applying structured thinking patterns
- Following constitutional template principles
- Implementing progressive disclosure templates

## Instructions

To apply cognitive templates constitutionally:

1. Select appropriate template type
2. Provide context for template application
3. Execute template with constitutional validation
4. Review structured results with progressive disclosure

Available templates:
- "chain_of_thought": Sequential reasoning template
- "few_shot": Example-based learning template
- "verification": Quality verification template
- "role_playing": Role-based analysis template
- "understanding": Deep understanding template

## Constitutional Framework

Templates implement constitutional principles:
- Progressive disclosure: Hierarchical information organization
- Cognitive convenience: Clear, unambiguous structure
- Information encapsulation: Self-contained template application
- Cognitive gestalt: Complete reasoning units

## Template Benefits

- Structured approach to complex tasks
- Constitutional compliance
- Cognitive optimization
- Progressive information disclosure
