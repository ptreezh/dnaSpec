# Constitutional Progressive Disclosure Skill

Create directory structures following constitutional principles with progressive disclosure implementation and cognitive optimization.

## Purpose

This skill creates project structures that implement constitutional principles with progressive disclosure, allowing information access at different detail levels while maintaining cognitive convenience.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating project directory structures
- Implementing progressive disclosure
- Following constitutional design principles
- Optimizing cognitive convenience

## Instructions

To create constitutional progressive disclosure structure:

1. Define project requirements
2. Choose disclosure level (basic/intermediate/advanced)
3. Execute structure creation
4. Organize content with progressive access

Levels available:
- "basic": Essential structure with minimal disclosure
- "intermediate": Modular structure with moderate disclosure
- "advanced": Complete structure with full disclosure

Parameters:
- "project_name": Name of the project
- "disclosure_level": Level of progressive disclosure
- "requirements": Project requirements for structure

## Constitutional Implementation

The structure follows constitutional principles:
- Progressive disclosure: Hierarchical information access
- Cognitive convenience: Clear, organized structure
- Information encapsulation: Modular, self-contained units
- Cognitive gestalt: Complete structural units

## Benefits

- Graduated information access
- Reduced cognitive load
- Constitutional compliance
- Cognitive optimization
